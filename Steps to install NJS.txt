# Day 15
- What is NodeJS?
- Server Side Programming (It can connect with DB) vs Client Side Programming
- The JS in NodeJS does not only define that it can be used only in client side
- Backend Engineer vs Front End Engineer
- We can use Javascript in server environment, apart from Browser only.
- It is Asynchronous in Nature.

- NodeJS vs (JAVA[Servlet, JSP], PHP, ASP, .NET, Ruby Rail)
- Older Generation does not Understand what is callback
-Advantage or  Disadvantage (Programming Style / Structure) :: [Scripting Language]


Install NodeJSfrom its website and Entension of NodeJS Snippets from VS code

open terminal:

>node -v      //shows version of NodeJS

>npm -v    //shows version of Node Package Manager


click on the left bottom of VS code to open terminal
make sure the type of terminal in use is not powershell


If any error occurs:-

Ctrl + P---> Select default Cmd or Command Shell

> npm init   // to initialize node js...through we are trying to solve Programming Style / Structure problem

> Enter		//this will create a package.json file

Create a file with .js file in it

We are following Naming Convention for file as:-
-small case
-avoid special char.(space also)
-will follow . to add multi word filename
-MAIN Program=> index.js first file or main.js


Note: Run all the above commands in the present folder where you are working or where the .js file is

Create an index.js file

write......console.log("Hello World"); in it


Now, to run this 

> node <folder-name>/<file-name>.....//>node src/index.js...OP is shown in terminal


Now,

create another js file....1.js
====================================================

function helloWorld(){
	console.log('I am Named Function');
}

helloWorld();

=========================================================

Here, we can pass any type structure eg JSON, int, float, XML



What is Module? and Module Management?

==> It is the connection/import, export of files with each other using module.export & require keyword



In createServer part....when we create it and then type node <folder-name>/<file-name> then server gets started.

After this try to type the port no with localhost:<port-no> in the browser to see the OP.



What is the importance of a project file?

==> It contains the package.json file which makes it special.


All the variables and functions are private in nature.


In our file my.module.2.js....we write module.exports.MY_APP_NAME = APP_NAME;
...where MY_APP_NAME is obtained as a key value pain in other file.



To normal objects also it will take it as key value pairs
