            <p>"This is a donation platform for supporting different NGO's across India.
                We have different NGO's who are working for the upliftment and betterment of 
                poor people and their families.
                India had 73 million people living in extreme poverty which makes up 5.5% of its total population,
                according to the Brookings report. In May 2012, the World Bank reviewed and proposed revisions to their poverty calculation
                methodology and purchasing power parity basis for measuring poverty worldwide. It was a minimal 3.6% in terms of percentage. 
                As of 2020, the incidence of multidimensional poverty has significantly reduced, declining from 54.7 percent to 6 percent.

                The different definitions and underlying small sample surveys used to determine poverty in India have resulted in widely varying estimates of poverty from the 1950s to 2010s.
                In 2019, the Indian government stated that 6.7% of its population is below its official poverty limit. Based on 2019's PPPs International Comparison Program,
                According to the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDG) programme,88 million people out of 1.2 billion Indians, roughly equal to 6.7% of India's population,
                lived below the poverty line of $1.25 in 2018â€“19.

                From the late 19th century through the early 20th century, under British colonial rule, poverty in India intensiied, peaking in the 1920s.
                Famines and diseases killed millions each time. After India gained its independence in 1947, mass deaths from famines were prevented. Since 1991, rapid economic growth has led to a sharp reduction in extreme poverty in India.
                However, those above the poverty line live a fragile economic life.
                Thus we as a Helping Platform trying to help in terms of Money, Clothing, Food & education try to serve this entire poor workforce.
